## Tic tac toe react tutorial

The goal of this project was to begin learning react after completing tictactoe
from scratch in CPP and following a react tutorial to help translate.

I've saved and pushed this to github as a placeholder to continue learning and
to add an computer player ai using the minimax algorithm which I have written in
CPP already.
